A list of errors/changes to v1.0: 
1. R53, R54: 0402 footprint incorrect (too large). Using 0603 part instead for v1.0 assembly. In the future, correct footprint.
P/N: P100DBCT-ND
M/N: ERA-3AEB101V
2. C24, C25, C26 need to add orientation to capacitors on board. Also check for any other polarized caps.
3: Fix X4 orientation on silk screen.
4: Fix R36 part value - should be 422k but ordered 442K
5: Fast Trigger Fixes - These resistor values work. 
	- DONE R43 and R47 should be ~880
	- DONE R42 should be 2.5k
	- DONE R46 should be 1.7k
	(Basically, the 10k resistor at R43/47 created too large a voltage drop since the LE pins sink/source up to 150uA)
6. Check C63 on board/populate list - looks good
7. Change feedback resistors for power sources if necessary
	- 1V2: R33 & R36; Voltage = 1.165 low load
		        Voltage =  high load
	- 1V8: R32 & R34; Voltage = 1.777 low load
			Voltage =  high load
	- 3V3: R35 & R37; Voltage = 3.25 low load
			Voltage =  high load
	
	- 2V3_1V9_Pre: R20 & R22; Voltage = 2.268
	- 1V9: R29 & R30; Voltage = 1.881 
	
	- 2V8_2V5Pre: R16 & R18 (maybe don't change); voltage 2.768
	- 2V5: None. Voltage = 2.445V

	- 3V6_Pre3V3: R17 & R19 (maybe don't change): voltage = 3.566
	- 3V3: None Voltage = 3.269

*** After measuring all voltages, decided to leave all resistors the same
    EXCEPT I fixed the R36 part number to be the actually correct resistance.
